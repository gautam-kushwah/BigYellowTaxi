# Introduction

The app is written in R and hosted on Shiny apps website. The app helps creates visualisation based on the data provided to it and helps the
user get a better understanding of the data and possibly make inferences.


### Software version
R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) -- "Bird Hippie"

RStudio 2021.09.1+372 "Ghost Orchid" Release (8b9ced188245155642d024aa3630363df611088a, 2021-11-08) for macOS
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 12_2_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) QtWebEngine/5.12.10 Chrome/69.0.3497.128 Safari/537.36

### What is R?

R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing


### What is Shiny?

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards


### Purpose of this App

The purpose of this app is to use the data provided on riders on the Chicago L over the past 20 years and use shiny to give people an interactive interface to create those visualizations. 
The app provides an interactive map with the locations of the stations marked on it with their respective line colors and tapping on the markers gives more information about the line that station serves and and the number of rides on a particular date.
The dashboard can also provide the difference in the number of rides between two dates on a particular station.

The data is presented on the map, in the form of a bar plot and also in the form of a table with controls for each of them

The app provides various data visualizations in the form of bar graphs breaking down data across all years, individual years, months, and even days in a week over a month.


The app could also help find interesting dates in the last 20 years which might have affected the behavior of the riders and thus help us understand the power of data and data visualization.

### How to use the App?

You can head over to the app [!here](https://gautam-kushwah.shinyapps.io/424_project2/). Upon opening the app, you would be greeted with a Shiny dashboard which would give you a map with locations of the stations marked and a bar plot for the toal number of rides for all the staions on that day. 

The app has three sections

1. Home Page
2. About Page
3. Yearly Plots page

These sections could be navigated through using the navigation bar on the left.

## Home Page

<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40148194/158264992-1571f6f4-8f8f-4897-8d2b-bff3d5c05aeb.png">


The home page has all the controls for the visualisations shown i.e the map with station locations and their data, a bar plot with total entries for that day for all the stations and a table representing the same data, in a separate section marked input controls.

From here the user can select the date and the visualisations would be updated.

The user can select to order the bar graph and the data table using the "Select the order of the bar chart" dropdown. The three options available are
Ascending, Alphabetical and descending.

There are also **Prev Day** and **Next Day** button to quickly see data for the previous day and the next day respectively.

The app has two modes of visualisation

1. Single Date
2. Different Dates

The different dates mode enables the user to select two different dates and then uses the difference between the ridership information on those two dates to make all the visualsation. All other controls work as before.


### Different dates mode

## Yearly Plots Page

The yearly data visualizations in the form of bar graphs breaking down data across all years, individual years, months, and even days in a week over a month for a particular station.

The user can select the station from the list of all the stations on the left or from tapping a station on the mao. The user can also select the year for which they want to see thr visualisations.

The user can also select whether they want to see the visualisations in the form of bar plots or in the form of tables.

# About the Data


The data was obtained from Chicago Data portal, the link to the data could be found [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Daily-Totals/5neh-572f)

This list shows daily totals of ridership, by station entry, for each 'L' station dating back to 2001. Dataset shows entries at all turnstiles, combined, for each station.

The data consists of 5 columns and about 1.09 million rows.

The columns are as follows
**station_id** - Unique ID for a station

**stationname** - The name of the station

**date** - The date of the entries

**daytype** - W=Weekday, A=Saturday, U=Sunday/Holiday

**rides** - total number of ridership on that date



The other files which contained the latitude and longitude of the stations was also taken from Chicago data portal which could be found [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-System-Information-List-of-L-Stops/8pix-ypme)

The columns are as follows

**STOP_ID**  

**DIRECTION_ ID** Normal Direction of train taffic at the platform

**STOP_NAME**

**STATION_NAME**

**STATION_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME**	- A more fully descriptive name of a station. 

**MAP_ID**

**ADA**	- Boolean (if the station is ada compliant)

**RED** - Boolean (if the station serves red line)

**BLUE** - Boolean (if the station serves blue line)

**G** - Boolean (if the station serves green line)

**BRN** - Boolean (if the station serves brown line)

**P** - Boolean (if the station serves purple line)

**Pexp** - Boolean (if the station serves Purple Express line)

**Y** - Boolean (if the station serves Yellow line)

**Pnk** - Boolean (if the station serves Pink line)

**O** - Boolean (if the station serves Orange line)

**Location** - The latitude and longitude values




### R Libraries required to process the data

```
library(shiny)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(shinydashboard)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.providers)
library(leaflet.extras)
library(DT)
library(shinyjs)
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2) 

```

The date was provided in a chr format, therefore it had to be converted into a usable format which was achieved through a R library called **lubridate**

The data was downloaded in tsv format, since the free version of Shiny allows us to only work with files which are <5 mb, I used shell script to break it down into smaller files using shell and the following command

```
split -b <size in kb> <filename> <name of parts>
```

The <name of parts> signifies what the broken down files would be named.


I then used a code editor to verify if the files were broken down correctly, and upon verifying that I loaded the filenames in a list in R and then stitched them together into a single table, hence being able to work with all the rows, using the code below
  
```
#read all file names in a temp variable
temp = list.files(pattern="parta..tsv")
allData2 <- lapply(temp, read.delim)
allData <- do.call(rbind, allData2)
```

I then extracted the the info on the lines the stop serves from  STATION_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME and created a new column and then merged the ridership data table with the stop info table
 
```
lat_long <- read.table(file = "CTA_-_System_Information_-_List_of__L__Stops.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE, quote = "\"")
lat_long$lines <- str_extract(lat_long$STATION_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME, "\\(.*\\)")
lat_long$lines <- str_remove_all(lat_long$lines, "[\\(\\)]")
lat_long <- lat_long %>% distinct(MAP_ID, lines, .keep_all = TRUE)
mergedData <- merge(x = allData, y= lat_long, by.x = c("station_id"), by.y = c("MAP_ID"), all.x = TRUE)
```
  
Next step was mapping the data onto the map for which I used the library **Leaflet**
  
The basic syntax is below and a more detailed one could be viewed on the github repo the link for which has been provided above
```
map <- leaflet(options= leafletOptions()) %>%
      addTiles(group="Base") %>% 
      addCircleMarkers(data = df, lat = ~lat, lng = ~long, )
```

The code for plotting various tables and bar graphs could also be found there

# Observation and Inferences 

  
### 1 Addition of more stations to yellow line
<img width="740" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40148194/158276742-9d5fc7ef-55fe-45d0-8c3d-477e2391a70c.png">

  Using these images from the map it is clear that a new station was added to the yellow line
  
  Furthermore, we can inspect that there is a huge gap in ridership entries in the year 2015 for Oakton/Skokie
  A quick internet search reveals that there was a dam collapse near the railways lines leading to closure of the station
